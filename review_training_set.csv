147,0,1,4/4/2015," Temple run is a great game. I love playing it because it is fun and does not drain my battery;however, it would could improve by when we upgrade a new runner we do not lose our coins. For example if u had 50000 coins and karma Lee was  worth 50000 coins it would just unlock her and let me know instead of me losing my coins.

195,0,1,4/9/2015," Absolutely fantastic, this game is few I accept for zombie evolution. They bring fun challenging mini bosses on the field to backup those pesky zombies. Campaign missions take 20 minutes to cool down but you won't notice because there are many activities to keep the zombie smashing going. All great aspects aside, the more you progress so do the zombies. And it just takes more and more money for guns, machetes, grenades, and whatever you choose to take. Which brings me to why I only give it 4. Stuff gets way to expensive and can't really take different things to switch it up without slowing down or getting dominated. Plus a new variety  of weapons for the game would be amazing. Granted there's quite a bit to choose from, but any gun lover knows that there's more than a couple guns that they wanna shoot.

That's why when I first saw this version, I was a little disappointed that the maps were exactly the same with just a graphical and interface upgrade. However after playing it for awhile, the added value is the achievement system which makes you want to return to play it.                                        I mean let's face it..

It is extremely difficult to get good monsters b/c of the gem system. You are then stuck with low damage dealing monsters for most of your campaign journey.

But it's easy to keep playing if you're just looking for something to pass the time or mindlessly watch. It's easy enough to do the regular dungeons with 5 star maxed or near maxed monsters. Enhancing them takes a lot of gold, however. You may end up waiting until Friday to get enough gold once the levels increase. Also,  if you expect to get gems for passing ""malia range"" which is an easy beginner dungeon, don't.  It never connects when I try to claim my prize.  Next day it's like I didn't even win it.
